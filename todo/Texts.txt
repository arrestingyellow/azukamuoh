MENU
Home, works, resume, about, contact, archive.
Archive should have a drop down menu with art and film. whichever they click will take them to the respective archive page.
Alternatively, it can be without a drop down, and take them to a single page (which we'll do later) that has an art and film tab that can be switched between. - D


HEADER SECTION
Hello, I'm Azuka Muoh -D
Contemporary Artist. Film Director.- D
The image under should be changing at random (3 secs). I added the pictures I want there in the folder. - D
If this is stressful please leave it and use just the first image.


FEATURED PORTFOLIO
All artworks should have their title and year written under them. At the centre there should be a button that says art archive. -D
This button will take you to an archive of artworks. Under the film tab too, there should be a film archive button that takes you to an archive of film works.
However if we don't do the drop down menu, we'll stick to one archive page with an art and film tab. What do you think?
The artworks are in the folder. Here are the links for the films:

https://youtu.be/6PuV6lk8Lfk - D

If we do these buttons then we'll have to take out the archive tab. What do you think?
Quick question: Do you think the film tab should come before the art tab? Which one should show first?

ACCLAIM
This Section should begin with this quote, written in italics, before the testimonials.

"Azuka�s incredibly thoughtful answers gave me a lot to consider. The thesis of her approach seems to be in this concept of �changing the order�
 By changing the order of images � creating that element of surreality � Azuka challenges the order of her reality as well. The link to activism and changemaking becomes so clear!
 
Azuka�s work is heavily influenced by her life. But it doesn�t only reflect. It distorts, and in doing so, it upends the societal narratives of marginalization. 
In Azuka�s work, the semiotic process relies on confusion to succeed. It is her approach to habitus that I believe ties everything together.  In this way, the semiotic process plays a large part in her work as well.
It is important to her what her audience will think of when they see her art.  It is important to her what it provokes and what it calls into question.
The transmission of meaning is a key element to the intentions of her art, and the distortion is a key element of that transmission."
-Andrew Kelly, Capybara Press

ARTIST STATEMENT
Please change artist statement to About Azu. -  D

Azuka Muoh was born in Lagos, Nigeria in 2000. Starting her career as a graphic and motion
designer, Muoh has amassed a number of skills along the way. Depicting the human condition, cultural oppression
and navigating new masculinity in the 21st century, Azuka ties her practice of surrealistic art and filmmaking into a
single mantra; Changing The Order. - D

I think this is all. Let me know if anything. Thanks!
